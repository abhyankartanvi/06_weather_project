# 06_weather_project

Description: Weather Dashboard project was my homework assignment for Monash University's coding bootcamp.

This project utlises HTML, CSS and Javascript to render a weather dashboard. I have also utilisted third party APIs namely JQuery and BootStrap. Additionally, I have incorporated server side API open weather API.

Application requires user to input "city" in the search area. Website displays current weather and 5 day forecast.

Challenges: currently working on fixing the 5 day forecast date issue and local storage. Unable to complete due to work commitments.
